A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Professor Collignon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C wont kill the virus; however, UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, but staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. The delicate tissues behind the nose are likely starting points.",,https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=claim-from-an-uncle-who-graduated-with-a-masters-degree-and-worked-at-shenzhen-hospital-offers-advice-on-covid-19-symptoms-and-treatment,false/misleading

Rothschild.” The application has been filed on May 17, 2020 as per the screenshot. The highlighted portion in the document also states that a “provisional application” was filed on October 13, 2015. Vishvas News investigated further by searching the patent on the website of Espacenet. Espacenet is a platform for searching patents and applications. It contains data on many patent documents from around the world. We found the application for a “System and Method for Testing for COVID-19” is listed on Espacenet. As per the document, the filing is a continuation of an existing application. The Rothschild’s patent was initially filed in the year 2015 for a method of “acquiring and transmitting biometric data.” However, as per the patent’s abstract, the application was later submitted in May 2020 as the method can be used “determine whether the user is suffering from a viral infection, such as COVID-19.” We also found the application via Google Patents. Vishvas News spoke to Chaitanya Zanpure who is a Patent Agent. As per her, “the claim is false. The image is the screenshot of the child application filed in 2020.

We did not find the mention of millets anywhere, which would suggest that millets save people from contracting coronavirus. However, in one of the sections on the WHO website, we found a report titled :”Nutrition advice for adults during the COVID-19 outbreak“. In this advice, WHO recommends including ‘millets’ in their diet, however it does not mention anywhere that eating millets provides protection from coronavirus. “Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), and foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).” “Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. So you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs. Drink enough water. Avoid sugar, fat and salt to significantly lower your risk of overweight, obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer,” the nutrition advice says. Read it here. The viral message also claims that the number of cases in the rural India are less, we checked if that infact was true or not. In this regards, we found a PTI report carried by Deccan Herald on September 5, 2020. The report says: “Though there are no exact numbers about the spread of the virus into rural areas, there is enough evidence to suggest it has reaced most corners of India and there is ommunity transmission, say experts” Read the entire report here. We found an article posted by “International Crops Research Insititute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)” on May 24, 2020. The article titled, ‘COVID-19 CALLS FOR RENEWED FOCUS ON EATING RIGHT AND NATURAL‘, mentions, “Richness of millets in micro-nutrients can be gauged from the fact that few of them could be natural substitutes to correct micro-nutrient deficiencies in an individual. For example, finger millet (ragi) has three times more calcium than milk; and pearl millet, another popular nutri-cereal, has highest amount of folate amongst cereals.” Read the article here. During the internet search using some keywords, such as, ‘millets, immunity, coronavirus’, Vishvas News found an article published on April 28, 2020 in The Hindu’s Business Line. The report was titled: Strong immunity is a key weapon in the fight against Covid-19 It mentions; Build good immune system with millets: IIMR (Indian Institute of Millets Research) The report says: “There are many sources of foods that are known as immunity boosters, and being a staple cereal, millets may prove to be a promising source, especially relevant to the times of Covid-19 virus pandemic situation, they said.” Read the entire report here. This report too suggests building immunity through the consumption of millets, it does not specify that eating millets would provide protection from coronavirus. Vishvas News in its last step of investigation interacted with Dr. Vilas A Tonapi director of Indian Institute of Millets Research. He told us that immunity is related to food and hence, it is advised to include millets in the food to boost immunity during the times of pandemic. He said that grains like jowar, ragi, foxtail, bajra and others are promising cereals which are nutritionally superior to major cereals and serve as a good source of protein, high dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and micronutrients. And hence these help in boosting the immunity. However, he also stressed that there are is no validation on the claim that millets provide protection from coronavirus. There are no studies that suggest the same. In the end we checked the page that had posted the claim on Facebook. The page, “वक्रतुंड फिटनेस क्लब राजगुरूनगर” is situated in Rajguru, a town in Maharashtra and it is followed by 457 people.

WHO recommends the use of MEDICAL masks for health workers, people who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19. WHO advises that governments should encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of COVID-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible – such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments. She also shared some important links of advisories issued by WHO on masks. According to WHO, governments are advised to encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of COVID-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible – such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments. Masks can be categorised as medical masks or non-medical / fabric masks. WHO’s guidance provides specific considerations for the use of non-medical masks, also known as fabric masks, by people as a means for source control in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare suggests that people who are not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house. This will help in protecting the community at large. The old guidance was on the WHO’s website in March 2020. Dr. Baller’s video published in February 2020 on usage of masks can be seen here.  In June 2020, the World Health Organization updated its guidance, which now recommends that the public wear fabric masks in areas where there is community transmission and where social distancing cannot be maintained. Fox News also stated in its report that WHO has changed its guidance on masks. Here’s the link of the report.  The post is shared on Facebook by a user named चंदन आर्य (Chandan Arya).

Face masks do not provide 100% protection from infection, therefore additional protection measures, such as physical distancing and good hand hygiene, are also important to practice. A preventative flu vaccine is another effective measure for protecting against flu infections. Similar to wearing face masks, the flu vaccine does not provide 100% protection. However, the flu vaccine can reduce the severity of illness and in turn the likelihood of flu-related complications and death, even in cases where the vaccine does not prevent an individual from getting the flu.",,https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=if-face-masks-work-to-protect-us-from-viral-respiratory-illnesses-like-covid-19-and-the-flu-and-weve-been-walking-around-in-them-for-months-then-why-would-anyone-need-a-flu-shot-right-now,false/misleading

During the second half of June 2020, the positivity rate, together with the number of people visiting hospitals due to COVID-19-like illness increased.

Immigrants and refugees coming into BiH are not using official border crossings, but illegal alternate routes, hence self-isolation imposed upon them is unrealistic.
